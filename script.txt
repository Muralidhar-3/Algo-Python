billionaires are not like you or me but it's  really important for them that you think they  
are so important in fact that some of them are  now spending millions of dollars every year for  
PR agencies to spread the message that they are  just regular people that drive regular cars eat  
at regular restaurants and live in regular homes  but in the age of flex culture why the are these  
people trying so hard to look normal why don't you  buy a Lamborghini man I didn't have any particular  
need for one I only say that because I've got a  follow-up question okay what's with the Honda this  
is a perfectly good car you bought a house for  45k yeah what is it like big or is it no small  
is it is small it's a tiny house Great Value 45k  mhm yeah I know it's a tiny it's a small small  
house I could buy any house in the world and  I don't want any other house than the one I'm  
in you know and that house is in a middle class  neighborhood I'm happy in a pair of khakis and a  
sweater so I I don't I I don't need fancy clothes  I don't need fancy food do you have an iPad I do  
not have an iPad iPhone no the now convicted  Frost Sam bankman freed once had billions of  
dollars of customer funds at his disposal to live  a lavish life in the Bahamas in the early days  
of FTX freed and his co-conspirators reportedly  drove around in the expensive sports cars typical  
of Crypt Bros according to evidence presented  during his trial SPF would later sell the cars  
and advise other Executives at FTX and Alama to do  the same because it didn't fit with the image of  
the company that they were trying to present  to customers and investors SPF shitty Toyota  
crwler that paid influencers made such a big  deal of was about as authentic as the company's  
internal accounting department the car the haircut  the wrinkled haircut were more carefully managed  
than customer funds the group did this because  they knew that the image of a boy Genius that  
didn't care about luxuries or power would be  appealing to people looking for an honest place  
to keep their funds SBF and the rest of the gang  were all frauds but putting a lot of effort into  
crafting a folksy image is done by most prominent  Business Leaders for three simple reasons that are  
mostly [ __ ] if you know these strategies you  will be able to see through what is little more  
than personal marketing the first reason that they  do this is because even if they aren't running a  
fraud acting like an every man still gets people  to give them what they want stealth wealth is when  
rich people buy products that are of high quality  but does not flaunt their wealth they do this  
because they don't want the attention and problems  that come along with people knowing that they are  
rich billionaires doing a Bloomberg or nass daily  interviews featuring their basic car and geeky  
wardrobe is not the same thing as stealth wealth  instead of hiding their financial means these  
people are just trying to show off as loudly as  possible that they don't care about their money  
or that their money hasn't changed them it's not  stealth wealth so let's call it poverty peacocking  
and it's a great move for their personal brand and  any companies they represent humble CEOs are the  
new fashion the world's biggest companies are run  by men who are hoodies and turtlenecks instead of  
tailored suits and other Business Leaders are  trying to emulate that Trend because investors  
like it if Business Leaders very publicly give  up flashy luxuries it also sends the message  
that they will be frugal running their business  and the data actually backs us up what role has  
luck played in your success well there's luck  enters into everybody's life according to a  
study conducted by the National Bureau of economic  research in 2012 CEOs and CFOs who were not Frugal  
in their own spending were more likely to have  instances of insiders perpetuating fraud and  
were more likely to push Equity based incentives  to increase their own income the study separated  
personally Frugal and flashy Executives by looking  for purchases like a personal car that was worth  
over $75,000 or a boat that was over 25 ft  billionaires and Executives didn't actually  
want to give up their luxuries so they just  started lying about it Buffett does own an old  
beat up car but he is usually driven around in a  fleet of Suburbans with a security team Zuckerberg  
wears the same gray shirt every day but they are  custom made by Brunello Cinelli musk does rent a  
tiny home next to the SpaceX Factory but the Wall  Street Journal pointed out that he spends most of  
his time in an 8,000 FT1 million mansion and all  of these men fly private they are welcome to these  
luxuries it is their money but there are still two  more reasons why they try so hard to pretend that  
they don't exist so it's time to learn how money  Works to find out why billionaires spend Millions  
to try and convince us that they spend nothing  this week's lesson is sponsored by zbiotics let's  
face it after a night of drinks I don't bounce  back the next day like I used to I have a choice  
to make I can either have a great night or a  great next day that is until I found zbiotics  
zbiotics is a preal probiotic that was invented by  a group of PhD scientists to tackle rough mornings  
after drinking here's how it works when you drink  alcohol gets converted into a toxic byproduct in  
the gut zbiotics produces an enzyme to break this  byproduct down it's this byproduct not dehydration  
that's to blame for your rough next day zbiotics  is designed to work like your liver but in your  
gut where you need it the most just remember  to drink zbiotics before drinking alcohol drink  
responsibly and get a good night's sleep to feel  your best tomorrow tomor the first time I tried

I drank the bottle of zbiotics before alcohol I  was amazed at how good I felt the next day head  
to zbiotics how many works and use code how many  works at checkout for 15% off thanks to zbiotics  
for sponsoring this video the second reason that  really rich people go above and beyond to look  
normal is because it is an effective sales tactic  if you make millions or even billions of dollars  
in your life I have good news for you unless  you made your money as a founder and CEO of a  
household name company or you are a celebrity it's  really easy for you to live a life where nobody  
knows who you are apart from your family close  friends and the people that work for you according  
to Forbes there are 2,640 billionaires on Earth in  2023 down from 2,668 in 2022 the publication also  
admits that many billionaires are not included in  this number because they could not collect data to  
accurately report their private fortunes even if  you are really interested in personal wealth you  
would probably know 50 of these people at most and  the rest just look like people in suits the point  
is that every other rich person you know about is  only known about because they want to be and why  
would they give up an easy life to enjoy their  wealth and peace it's because their own success  
is one of the best ways to sell stuff whether  it's musk promising that full self-driving is  
just around the corner Trump slapping his brand  name on everything or Kevin o role playing as a  
businessman to pitch FTX people bu success people  also buy relatability so the clever billionaires  
that want to use their image to boost their own  company will make sure that people can see them  
living lives that people can relate to and aspire  to at the same time the New York Post recently  
ran an article about Warren Buffett's wife who  was supposedly overheard complaining about how  
expensive a $4 cup of coffee was at the annual  Allen and& Company Sun Valley Conference which  
is nicknamed the summer camp for billionaires  this story is also picked up by Publications  
like Business Insider that ran it with the title  Warren it just became even more relatable for a  
billionaire if it wasn't obvious let me ruin the  fun for you nobody at this conference would have  
passed along this kind of personal conversation  to the Press you are reading about it because they  
want you to read about it Buffett's frugality  is credited in his Investment Company Success  
so he is selling an image just as much as Trump  is with his stakes and O is with his wacky pants  
for Buffett this is a better story than a bunch of  billionaires getting together to talk in private  
about well who the knows the only information  that seems to leak from these events is how  
expensive the coffee is being relatable is an  equally important sales tactic to people who  
want to sell a get-rich quick course an important  element of any grift like this is that people need  
to believe that someone has become wealthy and  that they can do it too so grifters will often  
talk about their humble beginnings while standing  in front of a rented Lamborghini this creates  
a situation where a lot of the people you see  promoting their courses on YouTube will be poor  
people pretending to be rich people pretending  to be poor people bill billionaires and get-rich  
quick core salesmen presenting a different image  of themselves to the world than who they really  
are behind closed doors probably won't surprise  most of you but there are two ways this s is  
hurting the personal finances of regular people  the first way is simply the financial harm that  
buying into the Trope of the relatable millionaire  or billionaire can do to people who follow them  
blindly successful people telling regular people  to cut down on luxuries to improve their financial  
situation is fine but if they are telling them to  cut down on luxuries to take on a side hustle so  
they can spend their money on a course instead  that's obviously bad and it tragically happens  
all the time it's easier for people with something  to sell to ask people to cut down on discretionary  
spending if they have already built up a  personal brand around driving a cheap car  
and living in a tiny house even after they become  a millionaire being a Frugal millionaire is also  
easier to fake if the supposed millionaires ever  get questioned about the legitimacy of their own  
success obviously grifter building an image so  that they can sell a bad investment or overpriced  
course are going to do serious Financial damage  to to the people they rope into their schemes  
but even the billionaires paying their PR teams  to get them positive media coverage about how  
relatable they are are still doing damage to  a lot of people's personal finances because  
they are reinforcing a common Trope in personal  finance that everybody's financial problems are  
caused by them spending too much the lies that  very wealthy people tell about their humble cars  
basic homes and average Lifestyle makes it easy to  guilt people for enjoying little luxuries because  
if Warren Buffett drives an old car why do you  need a new one this does not excuse The Reckless  
spending that a lot of Americans are guilty of  but it does take the attention away from their  
income after a certain point people can't improve  their personal financial situation by being more  
frugal they need to increase their income and  that's the third reason that billionaires spend  
too much money on looking poor it helps them keep  their workers in line the accounting firm ernston  
young in a report estimated that the number of  family offices in the world had doubled between  
2001 and 2016 family offices are investment firms  dedicated exclusively to to managing the wealth  
of a single family where you and I have some  shares on Robin Hood or Schwab the ultra Rich  
keep their money in family offices an article by  baren reported that one of the fastest growing  
expenses for these firms was public relations many  of these family offices are so big that they now  
have as much influence as private Equity firms and  with influence comes scrutiny private Equity firms  
are some of the most hated financial institutions  because they have a long history of bankrupting  
beloved companies and laying off thousands of  workers all to try and turn a slight better  
profit right um that's exactly right uh what we've  seen you know in uh industry after industry uh  
where private Equity buys up uh businesses is that  they're really responsible for some of the worst  
most abusive business practices in the country the  scrutiny has been very bad for private Equity but  
the anger is only directed towards the managing  partners of these companies when a family office  
does the same thing public outrage over job Cuts  would be blamed on the family and that's where a  
good PR team is employed it's easy for workers  to demand better wages from a company owner who  
is photographed lounging on a super yacht it's  easier for a company owner to push back against  
worker demands when all of their public profile  is about how they try to save every scent they  
can in the name of their business the author of  the article concluded that corporations became  
people as people too became corporations and every  corporation needs a media relations department now  
billionaires have been getting very good at this  but there is one that stands out Above All the
